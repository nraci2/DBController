Here is the pinout for the Raspberry Pi (GPIO Pins Allocation):

!!! PLEASE NOTE THAT ALL OF THE PINOUT NUMBERS CORRESPOND TO THE BCM NUMBERS !!!
!!!         THIS MEANS THAT GPIO2 IS **NOT** PIN 2 ON THE BOARD              !!!

If you need the BCM pinout for the Raspberry PI:

    1. Open a terminal on the RPi (or ssh into it)
    2. Use the command "pinout"
    3. There is the pinout info !

        EX: GPIO3 (5) ----> GPIO - Type of pin / 3 - BCM Number of pin / (5) Board Number of pin


!!! TO MODIFY PINOUT, PLEASE SEE ./config/rpi_io.ini !!!
